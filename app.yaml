# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27 for
# a list of libraries included in the SDK.  Third party libs that are *not* part
# of the App Engine SDK don't need to be listed here, instead add them to your
# project directory, either as a git submodule or as a plain subdirectory.
